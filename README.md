# Obstacle Avoiding Robot
In robotics , obstacle avoidance is the task of satisfying some control objective subject to non- intersection or non-collision position constraints . It has a sonar sensor which are used to sense the obstacles coming in between the path of robot . It will move into the best direction and avoid the obstacle which is coming in its path. By adding sensor in this robot one can simply collect data from the environment .
It can perform more precisely than many robots even in a small place .
